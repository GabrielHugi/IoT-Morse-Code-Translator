# IoT-Morse-Code-Translator
<p>IoT project made with arduino and some eletronic components in tinkercad</p>
<p>This project detects wheter a button press is a dot or dash based on how long it has been pressed for. There are separate buttons for indicating a new letter and a new word. The slide switch changes between input mode (receiving morse code) and output mode (printing the result)</p>
