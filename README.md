# IoT-Morse-Code-Translator
<p>IoT project made with arduino and some eletronic components in tinkercad</p>
<p>This project detects wheter a button press is a dot or dash based on how long it has been pressed for. There are separate buttons for indicating a new letter and a new word. The slide switch changes between input mode (receiving morse code) and output mode (printing the result)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The morse code translations on this project were based on <a href="https://morsecode.world/international/morse2.html">morsecode.world</a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: currently for the button press to be considered a dash you need to hold down on it, often considering it as a dot if you just click it twice fast. Will be tuned better later</strong></p>
